## What is mocks?

**mocks** is a Rust CLI tool that generates mock REST APIs instantly from JSON files. With zero coding required, it dynamically creates RESTful endpoints that support full CRUD operations.

## Key Features

<CardGrid stagger>
	<Card title="Zero Coding" icon="rocket">
		Just create a JSON file and get a REST API instantly
	</Card>
	<Card title="Full CRUD Support" icon="list-format">
		Auto-generates GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE operations
	</Card>
	<Card title="Dynamic Routing" icon="setting">
		Automatically generates endpoints based on JSON file structure
	</Card>
	<Card title="Fast & Lightweight" icon="approve-check">
		Built with Rust for high performance and lightweight binaries
	</Card>
</CardGrid>

## Usage Example

```json
{
  "posts": [
    { "id": "1", "title": "First Post", "views": 100 },
    { "id": "2", "title": "Second Post", "views": 10 }
  ],
  "profile": { "id": "1", "name": "mocks" }
}
```

This JSON file automatically generates the following endpoints:

- `GET /posts` - List all posts
- `GET /posts/1` - Get specific post
- `POST /posts` - Create new post
- `PUT /posts/1` - Update post
- `DELETE /posts/1` - Delete post
